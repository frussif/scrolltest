# 🖱️ Scroll Tracker

A simple browser‑based tool to measure and visualize your mouse scroll wheel consistency.

## ✨ Features
- **Real‑time tracking** of scroll events
- **Interval measurement** between each scroll step
- **Graph visualization** of scroll timing
- **History log** of past sessions with color‑coded intervals:
  - **Red** = intervals < 10ms
  - **Orange** = intervals > 25ms
  - **Black** = consistent intervals

## 🎯 Why use this?
Shows the interval between each step, useful for **BHOP/KZ** (bunnyhopping / Kreedz climbing), where you want your scroll intervals to be consistent for smoother movement.

## 🖱️ Hardware note
Normally, mice with **optical scroll wheel encoders** are more accurate than those with **mechanical, rotary encoders**.  
If you’re curious about your own mouse, you can test it here:

## 🚀 How to use
1. Open the [GitHub Pages demo](https://yourusername.github.io/yourrepo/) in your browser.
2. Start scrolling — the tracker will log each scroll event.
3. Review:
   - **Log box** for total scrolls, timing, and consistency analysis.
   - **Graph** for a visual representation of intervals.
   - **Interval history box** for a running list of your results.
4. Use the **Reset History** button to clear the log and start fresh.
