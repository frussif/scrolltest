# 🖱️ [Scroll Tracker](https://frussif.github.io/scrolltest/)

A browser‑based tool to measure and visualize your mouse scroll wheel consistency.

## ✨ Features
- Real‑time tracking of scroll events
- Interval measurement between each scroll step
- Graph visualization of scroll timing
- Interval history log (newest results on top)
- Color‑coded intervals:
  - **Red** = intervals < 10ms
  - **Orange** = intervals > 30ms
  - **Black** = consistent intervals
- **Strike‑through**: any interval that occurs in the *opposite scroll direction* from the session’s majority is shown with a line through it, making accidental direction changes easy to spot.

## 🎯 Why use this?
Shows the interval between each step, useful for **BHOP/KZ** (bunnyhopping / Kreedz climbing), where consistent scroll intervals are key.
Intended use is to scroll around 10 steps, or however many as you would when you play BHOP/KZ.

## 🖱️ Hardware note
Mice with **optical scroll wheel encoders** are generally more accurate than those with **mechanical, rotary encoders**.
